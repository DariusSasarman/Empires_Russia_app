An app that showcases the evolution of an empire in history! I made it in 2022 ( 3 years ago at the time of writing. Currently I'm not proud of the project's structure, but it's work i've done).


The purpose of this app was for me to start learning a bit of app development, and for people to learn a bit of history.

I chose russia as the first empire in this series because it was the most controversial one, at the time.


Here's a small preview :

Using the slider from the bottom the map can evolve in "time":

At each "time period" there's a lesson the user can read:

And a test that the user can take:
